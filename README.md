          -   <div style="color: #0d6efd;">Primary #0D6EFD</div>
          -   <div style="color: #6c757d;">Secondary #6C757D</div>

      -   #### Typography
          -   The Lexend font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Lexend is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.
        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
        1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
